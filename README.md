# Greenit

Greenit is a social, economical and ecological solution to replace industrial production by homemade and local production. Our first mission is to lead a community which supports knowledge sharing for healthy consumptions and productions.

Greenit places a high value on its reusability by the community and use of ethical tech, and is therefore FOSS whilst also avoiding using as many of Big Techâ€™s services as possible.

## Technologies

The progressive web app is built using the [Tailwind Framework](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/). [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) is used to handle GraphQL from the frontend.  

The backend is [Django](https://github.com/django/django) and the database [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).
