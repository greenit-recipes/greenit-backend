# Greenit

Greenit is a social, economical and ecological solution to replace industrial production by homemade and local production. Our first mission is to lead a community which supports knowledge sharing for healthy consumptions and productions.

Greenit places a high value on its reusability by the community and use of ethical tech, and is therefore FOSS whilst also avoiding using as many of Big Techâ€™s services as possible.


## Technologies

The progressive web app displays user-uploaded recipes sorted by categories and tags and is hosted on [DigitalOcean's](https://try.digitalocean.com/developer-brand-nofto/?utm_campaign=emea_brand-no-fto_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_exact_exact&_keyword=digital%20ocean&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwj6SEBhAOEiwAvFRuKPht-tyNGYt1NdkuSOOknBkfAxPBa8xCCiU0hH_GOQVUh6REBXUqRRoCm1cQAvD_BwE) servers. We use [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/) for analytics.

The frontend is built using the [Tailwind Framework](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/). [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) is used to handle GraphQL.

The backend is [Django](https://github.com/django/django)/[GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql) and the database [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).
